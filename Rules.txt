Rules of BlackJack:

-In this version of BlackJack, one player plays against the dealer.
-Both the dealer and the player are dealt two cards.
-One of the dealer's cards are hidden, while both of the player's cards are visible.
-Based on this information the player can decide to either Hit or Stand.
-To Hit Means to deal another card.
-To Stand means that no more cards should be dealt.
-The aim of the game is to get as close to, or ideally 21 exactly.
-Once the player is done, the dealer reveals their other card.
-If the dealer's cards add up to less than 17, they must hit.
-If the dealer's cards add up to 17 or more, they must stand.
-Whoever is closer to 21 is the winner.
